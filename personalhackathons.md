# personal hackathon exeperience

# LeWeb 2010 - Paris, France
## Who was on the team?
We were two iOS engineers, 1 graphic designer and 1 JS/Java developer.
## How did you hear about the hackathon?
We were attending the LeWeb 2010 conference in Paris and came to know about the event at the event. It was a very impulsive decision. We didn't have a chance to brainstom before the event. It was also everyone's first international hackathon.  
## What was the big idea?
The hackathon was sponsored by Alcatel-Lucent. They had created an API for real-time news and wanted developers to explore it. We wanted to create a small news app that leveraged their API to search article, photos, videos and more with a decent UI. We called it 'retilo news'.
## How did you come up with the idea?
The decision was easy for us because we were already constraint by the usage of Alcatel-Lucent realtime news API. Since it provided a real-time search API, we thought we could either go to a niche search app or a generic one. We went for the generic one as it was our first hackathon and we wern't feeling terribly adventurous or creative.  
## What were the major achievements from the hackathon?
In a typical hackathon fashion, we want to go as far with Appclerator Titanium as we could. We kept the design simple and a well defined scope. Note that apart from the person working on parsing the API responses, the iOS engineers had no background in JAvascript. We took great liberty at bending the rules of OO. We learned Javascript development and developing on the Titanium platform. 
## How did you make the technology choice?
We wanted to explore cross platform development tools. After spending some time with a Flash based cross platform app development tool (I think it was called Flex-something - not the Adobe Flex). We abandoned it within few hours because it was limiting our iteration pace. We then moved to Appcelerator Titanium, something I wanted to try out. It was in 1.6v at that point and was fairly simple. The decision came as a blessing because the API requests and responses because a breeze in JS.
## What challenges did you face?
First we spent some time tinkering with the flash based cross platform tool. It did not workout well. Its hard to predict things like that. The other major challenge was learning JS. It was also intersting to have a slightly different perspective to iOS application development because now we were not dealing with Apple provided public frameworks but a toned down JS framework on top of the native framework. It was also the first hackathon for most team members and they had a rough time pulling through the 24 hours. 
## Any other takeaways?
Impulsive hackathon signup has never worked for us. It is always good to give yourself time to get prepared mentally, physically and creatively. 

# AngelHack 2012 - San Francisco, USA
## Who was on the team?
We were 3 hackers. 2 iOS and one businessman.   
## How did you hear about the hackathon? 
We happened to be in San Francisco, CA around the time and had an entry pass (for another reason). This was an impulse decision to join the hackahton. 
## what was the big idea?
We created an iOS Application called HOBZ (happiness is our business) that authenticates thru company's basecamp account and lets you push messages to your colleagues in 140 or less characters. You can use hashtags and people tags (like twitter) and you have to attach an emotion by selecting an emoticon from the range provided. The idea was to track the emotions over time and aggregate the data in the long run and see the emotional map of the organization over time.   
## How did you come up with the idea?
We had an ideas brainstorm the night before. Me and the hustler put on table our ideabooks. This particular idea was originally called "Clienty" to keep track of my client's ever changing moods so that I can ensure equilibrium across my clientele. We changed it slightly to an internal tool to pass short messages with emotion. This required hooking up with a system that companies already use for quicker adaption (shoulnt have cared about it at that point and should have just worked on the product design itself - in retrospect). The reason we chose this idea over the other was its 'doability' and our general excitement about the idea. Its important that everyone in the team feels pasionate about the idea itself. While there were other projects on the ideaboook which were interesting, they were either too dreamy or too big to execute rapidly (or atleast we didn't know how to). 
## What were the major achievements from the hackathon?
We came up with a pretty solid useable application and it was fun. We learned the ins and outs of Basecamp API and ways to manage data internally. My group mate and I were very keen on keeping the code clean at that point. We increased our stamina to pull off an all nighter. 
## How did you make the technology choice?
Though this app could have lent it self much better to Appcelerators rapid development cycle, we chose native. We use the basecamp classic API to create a login. 
## What challenges did you face?
WE were two experienced developers but one got tired early. Two of us were working remotely in the office and had power breakdowns. [It pays off to prepare mentally ahead of time. most hackathons will land on weekends and if you are not mentally prepared in the week before, you may be overworked with no energy left for the weekend]. Also, the more hackathons you attend, the better you will understand your own physiology and psychology. Everyone has different productive zones. On a technical note, we wasted a lot of time with oAuth and parsing various variations of the same API. 
## Any other takeaways?
If possible, keep a hustler in your team - especially in hackathons where the idea itself is more important than the implementation. The hustler will make sure your message and idea is heard and brings you the required resources. 
Working at the site of hackathon is better than working alone. 

# ISB Civic hackathon - CodeForPakistan (ISB) - 2015, 
## Who was on the team
We were three people. 1 iOS engineer, 1 Android engineer/graphic-designer and 1 product/hustle guy. 
## How did you hear about the hackathon?
Thru social media. It was organized by CodeForPakistan and had some covereage on the social media. Its one of the first major civic hackathons and was well recieved in the technology and public service community. We quickly jumped on the oppertunity (even though it was 5 hours drive away from my city). I drove there a night before. 
## what was the big idea?
The idea was to create an application for serious civic hackers to find civic problems and to work on them. So, we created two applications. One for what we call "scouts" who find and post civic projects at a central location. These could be broken road or any other problem of a civic nature. The second app was for volunteers who can browse thru all projects in their vicinity, join them, share it with people and fix them. 
## How did you come up with the idea?
The night before we had a small brainstoming session where we put our ideabooks on the table. There was some on the go brainstorming as well. We looked at previous civic projects and what the hackathon organizer offered as advice. We picked "hull" because of its simplicity and how we could relate to it - all three of us. "Hull" means "solution" in urdu. 
## What were the major achievements from the hackathon?
We were able to hustle and get Savaree's founder/designer to critque and help on our app. (I doubt she even remembers anymore). The key insight: don't code! This was not a "code night". This was about coming up and prototyping rapidly ideas to engage people in a civic nature and solve civic hackathons (in case you are building a product). 
## How did you make the technology choice?
This was an odd team with an iOS and an Android engineer together. Luckily, we had two different mutually exclusive parts of the application so we decided to create both in different platforms for the demo purposes. To unify the two systems, we use Parse at the backend to store all our data. It was so easy to integrate parse across the platforms that way. We got cross paltform push notifications for free. 
## What challenges did you face?
We had to think really hard on how the product will eventually work. We worked hard on defining our personas and what they wanted from the application - what are the long term goals of a users. We iterated using paper mockups. We were very focused on clarifying user's intention. I think the lack of a designer/UX person (who knew thee tools really well and could mockup really quickly) was our major challenge. 

I had a major problem with my XCode installation during the hackathon. It would not build on my phone and that gave us anxiety thinking we wouldn't e able to demo. Then after a while, XCode started to give up on me. XCode simualtor would just freeze for no reason and I wasted hours on trying to figure it out. In the end I gave up and put new XCode on download over night (because the internet speed was too pathetic at that location). In the morning it turned out that reinstalling XCode didn't matter because it wasn't XCode's problem to begin with. We were using an external SDK for facebook authentication and sharing (ParseFAcebook) and its initial methods were creating that problem. So I just commented it out and it worked.
## Any other takeaways?
Always know the format of the hackathon. If you are given 3 minutes to pitch your idea in the end, don't worry too much about the implementation or the demo. Make sure to have a designer on speed dial or learn the design skills and work on your pitch.  

# NASA SpaceApps Challenge (ISB) - 2015

## Who are you and what do you do?
## Who was on your hackathon team?
It was me and my colleague who happened to be an iOS develoepr as well. He has 6 years experience in software engineering at that point. Several other colleagues attended the hackathon as well but we were split in different teams.  

## How did you hear about the hackathon? 
I am an avid follower of NASA, ESA and all things space related so it came by on my facebook newsfeed. At first I didn't expect that it would be in Pakistan as well but some renowned local blogs starting posting about it as well. It was then that I decided to join in. I motivated my colleagues and was able to take 7 other people with me. 

## What was your team's big idea?
NASA organized the hackathon in 4 themes, each with different challenges or challenge ideas. There were 4 major themes to pick from (Earth, Humans, Robots, Space) and there were several doable projects categories within each theme. The projects were sorted by Easy, Medium and Difficult rating. The projects were more like guidelines and material to help you with the project. Some projects had data sets with them while some did not require any data processing. Some of the projects required data processing but didn't come with a NASA provided data set. We chose the SPACE GLOVE challenge. It was about using hardware/software to make astronaut's life on a space mission easier. So we designed a robot arm controller out of a back-of-the-hand mounted iPhone. It uses the gyro and accelerometer to neatly track your movement and transmit it to the robot arm controller.

## How did your team come up with the idea?
I totally geeked out in preperation for this hackathon. I created an excel sheet after going thru all the challenges on the NASA website and grading, sorting them myself. Then I discussed it with my colleagues. It made their decision easier too. I decided to pick the spaceglove because it did not require data processing. I was not good at data processing at that time and from past hackathon experiences I realised it could pose a challenge. So I presented a vague idea of how we can use iPhone as a remote control (not the most original ideas I know). I didn't spend much time on refining the idea until very close to the hackathon day. At that point we decided we'll pick a robot simulator and hook up the iPhone with it. It turned out within few hours of the hackathon that its not going to be easy. So we decided to create our own small robot simulator using iOS [Dynamics] kit. I always wanted to learn it so I chose to build the robotic arm simulator while my partner worked on the iOS robotic arm controller. WE connected the two over multi-peer connectivity. My simulator ran on the iPad and you can control the robot in the simulator with the iPhone mounted on someone's hand. It was really fun!

## What key (technological) decisions did you make and how?
We worked on very small milestones of a few hours each. We version controlled early on which let us share code. We prototyped on the paper at first. We decided what the robot arms' ability will be - we researched how robot arms work and what is the state of the art. We then designed an inverse kinematic system for the robot arm and decided its functionality. Then we decided which functionality of the robot will link with what ability of the remote controller. We mocked out the debug mechanisms on top of the apps so we could see the data of our guages and iterate quickly. By the end of first day later that night, we had completed most of the functionality. Next morning we started demoing it to some key people and refining. We spend some good time on marketing the project on Twitter and created a video on vimeo.

## What were the major achievements or takeaways from the hackathon?
We got retweeted by ESA telerobotics team. That's a lifetime achievement unlocked. I learned iOS Dynamics engine and multipeer connectivity. I think it pays off in compound effect by preparing ahead of time, of working on the paper and being at synergy with your team members. Its also absolutely critical if you want to deliver an end/demoable project that you are experienced in your technology. 

Keep a tab open on local tech scene if you are in the developing world. Such events are not very widely publicized. Were were also covered by some prestegious local news providers.

## What challenges or setbacks did you face?
Hackathons are not just about programming. We made it to the global finals after having won the local contest. We were chosen for the public choice awards. We were in top 5 from more than 900 projects. Just two days ahead of the voting close, we were winning by a margin but then all of a sudden our voting power dropped and another european team took the lead. I think having a strong network in your local community for such things is important and its improtant to know how to market your product well. While we did learn in those 24 hours (and few days afterwards) about marketing and online promotion, I do agree it wasn't our best skill. 

We had travelled 5 hours prior to the hackathon and were terribly tired. I think next time I'd take a bus (not drive myself) if something like this happens or plan the travel with more margin for rest.

At one point when another team was presenting a full fledged voice controlled robot, we thought we'd lose. It turned out that the judges quickly realised that the other team was gaming the system. THey asked a lot of questions and then decided that it wasn't a hackathon project, that they had been working on it for months and hence they were disqualified.

# Lahore StartupWeekend (LHE) - 2015
## Who are you and what do you do?
## Who was on your hackathon team?
We were one backend engineer (PHP), one iOS engineer and a business executive (CEO of a company in Islamabad). 
## How did you hear about the hackathon?
I have been following the startupa scene in Lahore so I heard about it thru social media.  
## What was your team's big idea?
We wanted to cetralize the processes information of acquiring critical government issued documents. 
## How did your team come up with the idea?
I had been talking to my backend developers a few days before the hackathon. He had presented a few ideas and I presented mine. We decided that DocumentComplete is something both of us relate to very well (almost anyone would). We had a rough idea of what we wanted to build. 
## What key (technological) decisions did you make and how?
We decided to prototype with AngularJS becasue that was something we wanted to learn. We did a lot of paper mockups.
## What were the major achievements or takeaways from the hackathon?
I think one of the good things I experimented with was the design process. We timeboxed our brainstorm sessions to 20 minutes and everyone would take with them whatever they wanted to from the brainstorm. Each brainstorm was in a very specific feature or screen. Each person would then go back and do a paper mockup of how they envision it to work. This may take 15-60 minutes depending on the complexity of the feature. We would thn assemble and present the idea to each other, give our critique and do another smaller iteration on the designs. At this point we voted for each screen and picked the best one and moved on. Systematically, we had a good UX setup. The only downside was that it took a lot of time and we were not concentrating on implementing or prototpying it properly. We learned a lot about setting up our financials. We decided we'll need an IVR service so I hustled to talk to an IVR recorder to get a static recording. 
## What challenges or setbacks did you face?
We had no idea how to prototpye in AngularJS. While it was a fun time spent learning it, that usualyl isn't the intention in the hackathons. When you have an idea you want to build, make sure to pick a technology you know very well. 
## Any other memorable experience or take away form the hackathon?
There was a lot of good networking experience. I had a good experience presenting the idea to a whoele bunch of investors and their questions were fun. Obviously, no one saw our demo and I think we wasted the night toiling at the code screens trying to make Material design work in AngularJS somehow. 


# HackerRank CodeSprint
## Who was on your hackathon team (I need their field of expertise and level of experience)?
It was an individual only team. 

## How did you hear about the hackathon?
I follow hackerrank on social media and get a newsletter everyweek of upcoming online hackathons.
 
## What was you/your team's big idea? 
N/A

## How did your team come up with the idea?
N/A

## What key (technological) decisions did you make and how?
I decided to use C++ as that is my strongest language and library. It is also fast enough to stay under the watchdog radar for the online tests. Having a good C++ STL experience. I did switch to python when some algorithms got really intense to keep up with STL data structures. I think that is one of my weak point. 

## What were the major achievements or takeaways from the hackathon?
Picking the fastest langauge is good but it should not compromise developer productivity. While C++ data structures are super efficient, debugging them can eat up a lot of time. Most of it can be avoided by switching to python instead which is more declerative and readable while not a big compromise on speed.

## Any other memorable experience or take away form the hackathon?

- HackerRank CodeSprints (Online) - 2015 - Individual Competitive programming hackathon. 5 problems ranging in difficulty. Favorite kind of hackathons - very heady and intense. we had a few redbulls so that did slightly make me jittery. It was on a weekend and we had had a tough week. Thrilling as it may sound or feel, it is almost never a good idea to burn out. 

- TopCoder SRMs (Online) - 2008-2015 - 75 minute individual matches with challenge round, system tests.. very doable if your time matches.
