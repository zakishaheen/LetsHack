# personal hackathon exeperience
- LeWeb (Remote - Paris) - 2010, Retilo News, Alcatel-Lucent, Titanium Appcelerator, time spent in learning appcelerator - but was a strategic decision to include other team members but also to do rapid development. Alcatel-Lucent realtime API parsing was also more efficient done in JS. We had a designer, a middle-tier JS engineer and two mobile engineers. We had a fairly solidly designed application that performed fast too. It was a news app that took advantage of the real time APIs provided by alcatel lucent. The learning curve for JS is refreshingly easy - but since it does add a layer on top of iOS, you lose a lot of control. Depending on what kind of hack you are working on, this can be a blessing or curse. 
 
# AngelHack (Remote - SF) - 2012, HOBZ, iOS Native, Basecamp (lot of time waste in oAuth).
## Who was on the team?
We were 3 hackers. 2 iOS and one general. He is a product guy.  
## How did you hear about the hackathon? 
We happened to be in SanFrancisco around the time and had an entry pass (for another reason).
## what was the big idea?
We created an iOS Application that authenticates thru company's basecamp account and lets you push messages to your colleagues in 140 or less characters. You can use hashtags and people tags (like twitter) and you also attach an emoticon. The idea was to track the emotions over time and aggregate the data in the long run.  
## How did you come up with the idea?
We had an ideas brainstorm the night before. The three of us put on table our ideabooks. This particular idea originally called "Clienty" to keep track of my client's ever changing moods so that I can ensure equilibrium across my clientele. We changed it slightly to an internal tool to pass short messages with emotion. This required hooking up with a system that companies already use for quicker adaption (shoulnt have care about it at that point and should have just worked on the product design itself - in retrospect). The reason we chose this idea over the other was its 'doability' and our general excitement about the idea. Its important that everyone in the team feels pasionate about the idea itself. While there were other projects on the ideaboook which were interesting, they were either too dreamy or too big to execute rapidly (or atleast we didn't know how to). 
## What were the major achievements from the hackathon?
We came up with a pretty solid useable application and it was fun. We learned the ins and outs of Basecamp API and ways to manage data internally. My group mate and I were very keen on keeping the code clean at that point. We increased our stamina to pull off an all nighter. 
## How did you make the technology choice?
Though this app could have lent it self much better to Appcelerators rapid development cycle, we chose native. We use the basecamp classic API to create a login. 
## What challenges did you face?
Two experienced developers but one got tired early. we chose to work in the office and had power breakdowns. [It pays off to prepare mentally ahead of time. most hackathons will land on weekends and if you are not mentally prepared in the week before, you may be overworked with no energy left for the weekend]. Also, the more hackathons you attend, the better you will understand your own physiology and psychology. Everyone has different productive zones. On a technical note, we wasted a lot of time with oAuth and parsing various variations of the same API. 

# ISB Civic hackathon - CodeForPakistan (ISB) - 2015, 
## Who was on the team
We were three people. 1 iOS engineer, 1 Android engineer-cum-designer and 1 product guy. 
## HOw did you hear about the hackathon?
Thru social media. It was organized by CodeForpakistan and had some covereage on the social media. Its one of the first major civic hackathons and was well recieved in the technology and public service community. We quickly jumped on the oppertunity (even though it was 5 hours drive away from my city).
## what was the big idea?
We created two applications. one for what we call "scouts" who find and post civic projects at a central location. These could be broken road or any other problem of a civic nature. The second app was for volunteers who can browse thru all projects in their vicinity, join them, share it with people and fix them. 
## HOw did you come up with the idea?
The night before we had a small brainstoming session where we put our ideabooks on the table. There was some on the go brainstorming as well. We looked at previous civic projects and what the hackathon organizer offered as advice. We picked "hull" because of its simplicity and how we could relate to it - all three of us. 
## What were the major achievements from the hackathon?
We were able to hustle and get savaree's founder/designer to critque and help on our app. (I doubt she even remembers anymore). The key insight: don't code! This was not a "code night". This was about coming up and prototyping rapidly ideas to engage people in a civic nature and solve civic hackathons (in case you are building a product). 
## How did you make the technology choice?
This was an odd team with an iOS and an Android engineer together. Luckily, we had two different mutually exclusive parts of the application so we decided to create both in different platforms for the demo purposes. To unify the two systems, we use Parse at the backend to store all our data. It was so easy to integrate parse across the platforms that way. We got cross paltform push notifications for free. 
## What challenges did you face?
We had to think really hard on how the product will eventually work. We worked hard on defining our personas and what they wanted from the application - what are the long term goals of a users. We iterated using paper mockups. We were very focused on clarifying user's intention. I think the lack of a designer/UX person (who knew thee tools really well and could mockup really quickly) was our major challenge. 

I had a major problem with my XCode installation during the hackathon. It would not build on my phone and that gave us anxiety thinking we wouldn't e able to demo. Then after a while, XCode started to give up on me. XCode simualtor would just freeze for no reason and I wasted hours on trying to figure it out. In the end I gave up and put new XCode on download over night (because the internet speed was too pathetic at that location). In the morning it turned out that reinstalling XCode didn't matter because it wasn't XCode's problem to begin with. We were using an external SDK for facebook authentication and sharing (ParseFAcebook) and its initial methods were creating that problem. So I just commented it out and moved on.

## Any other takeaways?
Always know the format of the hackathon. If you are given 3 minutes to pitch your idea in the end, don't worry too much about the implementation or the demo. Make sure to have a designer on speed dial or learn the design skills. 



# NASA SpaceApps Challenge (ISB) - 2015

## Who are you and what do you do?
## Who was on your hackathon team?
It was me and my colleague who happened to be an iOS develoepr as well. He had a 6 year experience in software engineering at that point. Several other colleagues attended the hackathon as well but we were split in different teams.  

## How did you hear about the hackathon? 
I am an avid NASA, ESA and all things space related follower so it came by on my facebook newsfeed. At first I didn't expect that it would be in Pakistan as well but some renowned blogs starting posting about it. It was then that I decided to join in. I inspired my colleagues and was able to take 7 other people with me. 

## What was your team's big idea?
NASA had setup the challenges in a very organized manner. There were 4 major themes to pick from (Earth, Humans, Robots, Space) and there were several doable projects categories within each theme. The projects were sorted by Easy, Medium and Difficult rating. The projects were more like guidelines and material to help you with the project. Some projects had data set with them while some did not require any data processing. Some of the projects required data processing but didn't come with a NASA provided data set. We chose the SPACE GLOVE challenge. It was about using hardware/software to make astronaut's life on a space mission easier. So we designed a robot arm controller out of a back-of-the-hand mounted iPhone. 

## How did your team come up with the idea?
I totally geeked out in preperation for this hackathon. I created an excel sheet after going thru all the challenges on the NASA website and grading, sorting them myself. Then I discussed it with all the teams. I decided to pick the spaceglove because it did not require data processing. I was not good at data processing at that time and from past hackathon experiences I realised it could pose a challenge. So I presnted a vague idea of how we can use iPhone as a remote control (not the most original ideas I know). I didn't spend much time on refining the idea until very close to the hackathon day. At that point we decided we'll pick a robot simulator and hook up the iPhone with it. It turned out within few hours of the hackathon that its not going to be possible. So we decided to create our own small robot simulator using iOS [Dynamics] kit. I always wanted to learn it so I chose to build the robotic arm simulator while my partner worked on the iOS robotic arm controller. WE connected the two over multi-peer connectivity. My simulator ran on the iPad and you can control the robot in the simulator with the iPhone mounted on someone's hand. It was really fun!

## What key (technological) decisions did you make and how?
We worked on very small milestones of a few hours each. We version controlled early on which let us share code. We prototyped on the paper at first. We decided what the robot arms' ability will be - we researched how robot arms work and what is the state of the art. We then designed an inverse kinematic system for the robot arm and decided its functionality. Then we decided which functionality of the robot will link with what ability of the remote controller. We mocked out the debug mechanisms on top of the apps so we could see the data of our guages and iterate quickly. By the end of first day later that night, we had completed most of the functionality. Next morning we started demoing it to some key people and refining. We spend some good time on marketing the project on Twitter and created a video on vimeo.

## What were the major achievements or takeaways from the hackathon?
We got retweeted by ESA telerobotics team. That's a lifetime achievement unlocked. I learned iOS Dynamics engine and multipeer connectivity. I think it pays off in compound effect by preparing ahead of time, of working on the paper and being at synergy with your team members. Its also absolutely critical if you want to deliver an end/demoable project that you are experienced in your technology. 

## What challenges or setbacks did you face?
Hackathons are not just about programming. We made it to the global finals after having won the local contest. We were in for a voting on public choice awards. We were in top 5 from more than 900 projects. Just two days ahead of the voting close, we were winning by a margin but then all of a sudden our voting power dropped and another european team took the lead. I think having a strong network in your local community for such things is important and its improtant to know how to market your product well. While we did learn in those 24 hours (and few days afterwards) about marketing and online promotion, I do agree it wasn't our best skill. 

We had travelled 5 hours prior to the hackathon and were terribly tired. I think next time I'd take a bus (not drive myself) if something like this happens. 

At one point when another team was presenting a full fledged voice controlled robot, we thought we'd lose. It turned out that the judges quickly realised that the other team was gaming the system. THey asked a lot of questions and then decided that it wasn't a hackathon project, that they had been working on it for months and hence they were disqualified.

# Lahore StartupWeekend (LHE) - 2015
prepared idea, time waste in learning to prototype the application (we wanted to use the Google material design with angular). Divided between presentation and code. Should have worked more on UI and presentation - the idea was not totally understandable by everyone. The atmostphere was most energetic. [Expect some issues when some or most of your team members, or yourself even, are not familiar and experienced with the hackathons]. 20 minute brainstorm, 20 minute vote/discussion. 

- HackerRank CodeSprints (Online) - 2015 - Individual Competitive programming hackathon. 5 problems ranging in difficulty. Favorite kind of hackathons - very heady and intense. we had a few redbulls so that did slightly make me jittery. It was on a weekend and we had had a tough week. Thrilling as it may sound or feel, it is almost never a good idea to burn out. 

- TopCoder SRMs (Online) - 2008-2015 - 75 minute individual matches with challenge round, system tests.. very doable if your time matches. 

- Yelp Hackathon 18 (SF) - 2015,
