# Why attend a Hackathon?

Hackathons improve your existing skills and provide oppertunity to acquire new ones, fast. They also have a strong professional, personal and social impact as well.  
They make way for you to get out of the normality of the day job (and hence your comfort zone) and get your hands dirty in a challenging environment. Most jobs tend to get tedious, boring or simply not challenging enough. Sometimes the job diverges from your original or current passion. This may be becasue of your own self or because of things not in your control. Hackathons reignite the passion. 

### Skills
While it may be obvious that a 24-48 hour sprint of code would certainly push the limits of a programmer and improving his skillset in a short period of time, other professionals can get a great skill set boost too [rephrase]. Skill set improvements come in two flavors: Technical and behavioral. Let's start with technical ones. 

#### Holistic experience
Hackathons provide a holistic experience of solving a problem or creating a product. While in the day job, you might be responsible for a small part of something big - at a hackathon there is usually a small team which owns big chunks  of solutions. From inception to delivery, you own the pipeline and whatever passes through it. It is incredibly empowering but also daunting. It instills emphathy for other jobs in your discipline. It installs perservarance to complete. The only way out of a hackathon is through it.   

#### User experience
In most hackathons where you are creating a product prototype, the prime concern is the user experience. To the UX engineer, this may seem mundane - but it is incredibly important for other disciplines such as programmers, concept artists, engineers to put user experience first. You can get to learn UX tools, processes and common vocabulary. 

#### Cutting edge
Hackathons give you the leverage and freedom to be bold and risk taking. This means you can use whatever measures to complete your project including using the cutting edge technology. 

#### Existing tools
better understanding of working. novel usages. understanding of how tools work (or don't) with each other. 

#### 3rd Party tools
soon you will have a large repretoire of tools that other people make, and use them to create your solution. like uber was built using stripe and other tools. time to interact with those companies. time to understand the consideration that has gone into these tools. time to create your own such tools. Think about setting up a whole stack for a new application. Setup build with adruino and lego mindstom. A lot of hackers take pride, as badges, of which tools they used to create the solution. most time wheelinventors are a loss on hackathons.

### Behavioral
Hackathons are very commonly attributed for being behavior changing. Here are some of the things you can expect from attending hackathons:

#### code wins arguments
While some debate day in and out on the plausibility of a solution, a hacker goes out and codes it. Got an idea? Everyone does. Show us the code. Attending hackathons will instill in you a do vs talk habit. Most times, it does not take more than a focused weekend with a few talented people to really vhet out an idea. 

#### team work and interdependence
While the typical hollywood persona of a hacker is that of a lone hunter, hackathons are rarely considered individual battles. They are a team work. More often than not, the team consists of disparate individuals with different skill set. This creates an interesting setup for interdependence and team work. You will learn to ignore nuisances, weaknesses, personality lackings in others and you will start to see these in your own self if you have not seen already. Overcoming these will make you a stronger, resillient, more understanding person.

#### Pressure
The social pressure to win. the social pressure to live up to one's promise. add to that the 48 or 24 hour time constraint, team members you do not know about and other things. its a perfect setting for exercising the muscle of pressure. create endurance and sprint speed. increased focus. THe peer pressure to perform. 

#### Prioritization
While there may be room for losing time and redoing a particular piece of product at the cost of money, a hackathon does not have such a leverage. If you go down the wrong path, the price is paid, the time is lost and you must double up to cover up. It is then very important to prioritize the work and keep prioritizing based on the current situation. You will find yourself prioritizing and analyzing the cost/benefit of a particular task several times during the same hackathon. Sometimes, you will have to delay your meal because you prioritize the momentum of work - and sometimes you will have to prioritize sleep at the cost of current momentum because your prioritize the presentation over end product? 

#### rejection
Like code wins arguments, a hackathon is a commitment to accepting faliure or success. A hackathon is a win-win proposition. No one is a winner and everyone is a winner. everyone goes home proud. if your idea gets rejected or your team did not win anything or simply your idea was not liked at all, this is a place where this is rejoiced. a lot to unlearn from the societal norms. its okay to fail. its okay to crash. 

#### Completion 
initiation deficit
completion deficit
doing it over and over again, learning the feels of completing. 

#### Sportsmanship
Sportsmanship isn't about taking a losing in a good way but accepting success in a humbling way as well. Of about giving credit where its due. Of naming your team members in your success and highlight the giants upon whose shoulders you stand on. Hackathons will give you the oppertunity to improve upon your sportsmanship.

### Impact

#### Professional Impact
"Your network is your net worth". Hackathons are a great way to connect to the community of your discipline but also to expand into other disciplines. Its a great way for developers to connect with mentoring CEOs, designers, usability experts and even animal right activists. The data journalism hackathon called dhack brought together journalists, criminologists, public servants, developers and data scientists together. It would otherwise take a lot of hard work to get such a diverse group to sit together for even an hour, let alone a whole weekend. 

Hackathons also provide you an oppertunity to break into other fields of your occupation. A mobile developer experimenting with data science tools using crime data of his city not only expands his knowledge to data science but also to journalism. Learning by doing is a great way to expand the knowledge. 

We will see in later chapters that one of the major motivation for most organisations to throw a hackathon is so that they can find potential people to recruit. Hackathons are a great way to learn about other people you would want to work with. An interview only lasts an hour and is a very controlled environment. It also does not give oppertunity to see someone 'build' something, handle the pressure, prioritize, work with team members and handle rejection. More and more companies are investing heavily in throwing public hackathons that serve those who throw the hackathon and those who attend it. 

#### Personal Impact
Human fulfillment is a function that extends beyond job, salary and occassional fun. Humans want to connect with others. They need validation. Hackathons are a good place where you can lose yourself and connect to someone without the pressure of 'professionalism' and such. These interactions can someones lead to lasting friendships. 

Humans also seek to immortalize their existence in one way or the other. THey seek to leave behind a legacy, something that people may remember them with when they're gone. This drives the motivation to build things. Many people have an initiation deficit and hence cannot get their own selves to take the first steps towards building their dream product. Hackathon encourages and sometimes even tricks your brain into taking those first steps without you realising it. This brings immense personal satisfaction. More importantly, it brings encouragement and motivation to leverage the momentum. 

Soon the normalicy of the job kicks in. You have relationships, kids or other commitments and feel comfortable in them. To get thrown out of your comfort zone is the need of the hour for growth. Hackathons provide a controlled environment and platform to push yourself out of your comfortzone. Hackathons such as StartupWeekend force you to get out of your comfort zone as a developer and persue your product vision, get to the stage and pitch it and live up to the developer pristege you have gathered. Its a great place to challenge yourself into hustling to gain users, etc. 

#### Social Impact
Increasingly governments are realizing the potential of engaging the community in helping the government solve civic problems thru technology. With help of volunteers and private organisations, public offices throw civic hackathons. CodeForAmerica and its spinoffs across the world are doing wonders in creating better communities and solving hard problems. Governments are also investing in collecting, cleaning and publicizing their data to rest of the world to hack on. Code.org is engaging with youth to prepare them for future hackathons. Transportation, Crime, Vegetation, Utility consumption and several other kinds of data are readily available now. This creates an unprecedented oppertunity for the people living in the mellenial era to solve problems are scale. Hackathons are the missing link between civics and capitalism. They connect the best minds busy to build the next great app or product to come and solve the next big problem, for a 100,000 people. 

Another social impact of hackathons is inspiring the upcoming gnerations to engage in meaningful, drug-free and fun events that not only streches their brain, it brings a sense of civics in them as well.
