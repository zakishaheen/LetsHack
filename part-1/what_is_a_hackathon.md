# What is a hackathon
A hackathon is an event that spans typically 24 to 48 hours. It is a group event in which people collaborate to complete specific, well-defined projects. The nature of projects varies greatly. Participants of a Hackathon (called Hackers) may be co-located or distributed in virtual teams. They can be from the same occuptation or with diverse backgrounds and skillset. They could be tackling the same problem or working on a diverse set of projects. Sometimes they compete for a prize but usually that is not the motivation. Hackathons test novelty, endurance, problem solving, team collaboration and technical expertise. We will study these and more interesting topics that make Hackathons so engaging.
