# What is a hackathon?

Hackathon is 1 or more day long group event in which people collaborate to tackle any 'project'. The nature of a 'project' varies greatly. Participants may be co-located or distributed across the glove, from the same field or with diverse backgrounds and skillset, tackling same problem or working on a diverse set of projects. Sometimes they compete for a prize as well. It tests novelty, endurance, problem solving, team collaboration and technical expertise among other things. To get a deeper understanding of what a Hackathon is and why people spend time in it, its important to understand what the word "hack" means. 

# What is a hack? 

Hack litereally means to "cut open". In this book, I will take it to mean "to work on a project in a novel way to solve a problem". 

During the initial time of the interwebs, networking and connectivity enthusiasts started "hacking" the networking systems. They did it to make it work in new way (because of constraints) or to improve its performance, security, reliability etc.. It was soon realised that this could become an offensive weapon and hence some people started "hacking" other people's networks for fame and fortune. Hollywood found this glamorous and created a persona of a "hacker" - spectacales, allergies, toned down clothing, uncut hair and mighty speedy on the keyboard. They portrayed a hacker as someone "hacking away" on a terminal with 4-6 shell terminals opened, typing in commands at rocket speed and breaking any security barriers that may come their way. This gave rise to a cult like aspiration for people wanting to be 'hackers'. They started hanging out on cyber chat groups on IRC in the darknet. As is the case in most hollywood characters, 'hackers' were not normal people. Hence they didn't feel they should talk like a normal person either. It was considered standard to do a lot of homework and even then, think twice about asking someone on an IRC channel for help. GTFO, RTFM, STFU and other acronyms became common. All these groups still exist. The group was divided between phrackers, hackers, script kiddies to name a few. They were divided into white hat and red hat. Those were the dark days of "hacking".

Fast farword to mid 2000s when the same concept of "hacking" and "hacker" was turned around by the very people who kickstarted the culture to take back its legacy: the genuine computing enthusiasts. A hackathon was born. Initially, people thought this was a hacking festival where people would come and break networks across company, city or country boundaries. While that may have been the case and true in some cases, majority of  the hackathons tried to reclaim the original definition of a hackathon. Today a "hack" means a quick and novel solution to any problem. For instance "growth hack" means a novel, uncommon technique that uplifted a company or product's growth (user aquisition) exponentially. Within few years, the word has transformed not only from being a negative one to a positive one, it has seeped into other disciplines such as literature, hardware, travel, medicine, finance. Not only is there a flavor of a hackthon for each industry that requires a computer to work, other industries where computing is not so primary are also adapting the concept. Today, a typical hackathon is 24-48 hours long where participants usually use their skills around computing to create ingenuine products called "hacks". These could be a simple improvement to a website's front-end or replumbing of a more deeper sub-system. This could mean coming up with an new and disruptive outline for a math syllabus or a completely new instrument. this could means learning a new skill in a short time or coming up with a million dollar business idea. Hackathons have come to dominate and define the 2nd decade of this mellinium and it is only getting started.

Major takeaways so far. 

# Do your homework 
Learn about who the judges are, who the investors are, what were previous projects at similar hackathon, who are the mentors, which teams have participated, etc. 

# Maintain an idea-list 
Capture everything all the time even if you are not participating actively in any hackathon. Ideas are really fragile so make sure to have an idea capture tool near you all the time. Simply capture and spend an hour a month going thru the ideas and triaging them. It will give a lot of confidence before entering or signing up a hackathon. Always explore ideas, tools, technologies and products. Be aware that an idea list is not a place to pass a judgement on how good or bad an idea is- just capture it.

# Maintain a hack-list
A hack list is a set of technologies you would like to hack on. Keep this list as your stumble across things that excite you. Hackathon is all about getting excited, gaining momentum and leveraging that momentum to build something new. The opposite of happiness is not sadness, its boredom. So what makes your excited makes you happy. To maximize your happiness, hack on something that excites you. How awful would it be to draw a blank when you ask yourself, what will excite me in this hackathon?

# Have a go-to language
Have a go-to language that you know really well. This is very true for competitive programming competitions but also in product building hackathons. Sticking to your favorite language such as python for web programming will greatly reduce the stress and you will be able to focus on more important things. Do not attempt an MVP hackathon if you don't know the technology very well. You will stumble across small issues that will destroy your hackathon if you don't know how to get around them. 

# Learn a stack
Learn a stack. Any stack. Stay within your stack. Web is a great platform to tease out ideas. Learning a web stack will give you immense power to articular your idea into an MVP. Do not learn just PHP or Python, learn the whole stack including Apache, MySQL, AngularJS, CSS, etc. Trust me, you don't want to waste the whole hackathon simply solving JS dependency issues. 

# Invest time on paper
If you cannot draw what you are going to build, you may not be able to build it good enough - especially if you are in a team. 

# Know your team
Really whet your team during socializing round for compatibility and technology. It will be a miserable hackathon if you have to ask for what you can work on or someone nagging you all the time about something or the other to teach them. 

Build team with compatible skills (iOS+Android does not work. Node+iOS works. Drupal+Design works. App designer + game designer may not work if your aim is to build a product). A new learner can slow down the whole team. A thing to ask is, "Is my skill set compatible with my team?". Its better to say no early than feel sorry for rest of 24 or 48 hours of hackathon. 

# Have a designer
Have a designer on call even if your ideas are not design heavy. A designer can mean the difference between a mediocre and killer MVP. A designer can even make your business plan more beautiful and give valuable advice. Mostly you don't need to code all the edge cases. A simply mockup and click dummy would do just as fine. 

# Fuck "Its been done"
Forget about "its been done". Life has been lived - but you don't stop living, right? Everyone's nature, nurture and experiences are different. Even Zuckerburg wouldn't invent Facebook if he had to today the same as he did so many years ago. Want to build a social network, go ahead! Make sure to elaborate on your value propositions though. Build that app you feel excited about even if everyone tells you it has already been done. 

# Version control extensively
Its easy to lose data so make sure you know your tools properly and all team members are using it. 

# Get organized
Use a PM tool early on. Simple as simple as Asana or Wunderlist is good. You simply need a way to capture ideas, triage them and categorize them. If you have access to a whiteboard, a Kanban board works too. 

# Brainstorm != Planning
Separate brainstorm from planning and time box both. There is so much energy and everyone has advices. But the truth is that you have limited time and you want to get out with a solid something to show. So brainstorm 20-30 minutes for idea generation and welcome all ideas. Then spend an hour or so planning from the brainstormed ideas and cut down as much as possible to make it a doable scope. Identify risks and make them visible to everyone.

# Identify goals and strech goals 
This is the holy grail of your hackathon. This will motivate to spent another hour, write 100 more lines of code. Be aggressive. Take risks. Pivot and restart if you have to.

# Sleep well
Get plenty of sleep before the hackathon. If you plan it well, you can get sleep during the hackathon too!

# Don't over caffinate
Don't over caffeinate if you don't have to. Do what makes you most productive - but red bull will not give you wings or magically make your AngularJS learning ability double for the day. 

# Don't over feed
Don't over feed yourself. It will make you sleepy. Try to eat a small meal every few hours. Know that it takes 20 minutes or your stomach to realize that it has had plenty. Some foods will make you sluggish. Sweets are good in small quantities.

# Isolate yourself
Get all your other affairs in order - turn off the phone or put it on "Do not disturb" mode. Make sure to inform friends and family ahead of time to not disturb you during these hours. Don't come to a hackathon unless you are fully committed to it. 

# Invest in 3rd Party code
Rely heavily on 3rd party components. Hacking is not only about taking things apart for the sake of putting them together or building from scratch, its about make a sum greater than the parts. Find parts which work in a more novel way together. 

Identify your goal for the hackathon from the following:

1. Learn a new technology (hack list, pet ideas)
2. Make an MVP. 
3. Tease a concept. 
4. Make a business plan. 

For 1, you need a list of technologies you want to learn and define what 'learn' means. Focus on the end result. Do homework. Build something similar to what you have already built. In words of marie monterssori, when learning a new concept - make some things constant. For example, when kids are taught colors and shapes, don't give them a blue circle and red square and expect them to not mix up what red and square means. Give her a red square and red circle and they will be able to learn what shapes are - and if you want them to learn colors, give them a yellow circle and blue circle. Similarly, if you have built a calculator in .NET for desktop but want to learn angular JS.. make the same calculator. Ideas are very effective at hiding the complexity under the wraps of simplicity. You don't have time to unravel this. 

For 2, you should really have a good command on the stack. You should know how each component in the stack works and what your limits are within it. If you are consuming APIs make sure you know, in your stack, how to efficiently parse and store JSON or XML. Learning it on the go is going to waste time. A hack around this is to use a third-party component. 

For 3, know a very good prototyping tool and have a good designer. As it eventually is all about presentation make sure you know your tools very well. Clarify early on what your prototype will be (a slideshow, click dummy, working prototype?). Unless you have design skills (visual and functional), do not attempt to tease this. It is not easy. Like I said earlier, complexity can be hidden under the layers of simple ideas. 


For 4, know your numbers. Know basic finances. Know your market and know your user base. have a designer and work on polishing the presentation. Poke holes in your business plan. 

"Having fun" is not a goal. The fact that you showed up at the hackathon means that the fun has started. Now is the time to go through the pain. 


You will need experience in any of these categories to gain reasonable results at the end of the hackathon. Experience hackers can aim for multiple or even all of the above goals but it is going to be incredible hard. I do not recommend for beginners as even I don't consider myself to be at that level yet. (does it even exist?)



Balance pain and pleasure. 

Work backwards if there is a presentation involved. Think about how your demo would be like. Think of the mimic possible demo wit hate maximum possible effect.
