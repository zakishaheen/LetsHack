## What is a hackathon?

Hackathon is 1 or more day long group event in which people collaborate to complete any 'project'. The nature of a 'project' varies greatly. Participants may be co-located or distributed across the globe, from the same field or with diverse backgrounds and skillset, tackling same problem or working on a diverse set of projects. Sometimes they compete for a prize as well. It tests novelty, endurance, problem solving, team collaboration and technical expertise among other things. To get a deeper understanding of what a Hackathon is and why people spend time in it, its important to understand what the word "hack" means. 

## What is a hack? 

Hack litereally means to "cut open". In this book, I will take it to mean "to work on a project in a novel way to solve a problem in a short period of time".  

During the initial time of the interwebs, networking and connectivity enthusiasts started "hacking" the networking systems. They did it to make it work in new way (because of constraints) or to improve its performance, security, reliability etc.. It was soon realised that this could become an offensive weapon and hence some people started "hacking" other people's networks for fame and fortune. Hollywood found this glamorous and created a persona of a "hacker" - spectacales, allergies, toned down clothing, uncut hair and mighty speedy on the keyboard. They portrayed a hacker as someone "hacking away" on a terminal with 4-6 shell terminals opened, typing in commands at rocket speed and breaking any security barriers that may come their way. This gave rise to a cult like aspiration for people wanting to be 'hackers'. They started hanging out on cyber chat groups on IRC in the darknet. As is the case in most hollywood characters, 'hackers' were not normal people. Hence they didn't feel they should talk like a normal person either. It was considered standard to do a lot of homework and even then, think twice about asking someone on an IRC channel for help. GTFO, RTFM, STFU and other acronyms became common. All these groups still exist. The group was divided between phrackers, hackers, script kiddies to name a few. They were divided into white hat and red hat. Those were the dark days of "hacking".

Fast farword to mid 2000s when the same concept of "hacking" and "hacker" was turned around by the very people who kickstarted the culture to take back its legacy: the genuine computing enthusiasts. A hackathon was born. Initially, people thought this was a hacking festival where people would come and break networks across company, city or country boundaries. While that may have been the case and true in some cases, majority of  the hackathons tried to reclaim the original definition of a hackathon. Today a "hack" means a quick and novel (usually dirty) solution to any problem. For instance "growth hack" means a novel, uncommon technique that uplifted a company or product's growth (user aquisition) exponentially. Within few years, the word has transformed not only from being a negative one to a positive one, it has seeped into other disciplines such as literature, hardware, travel, medicine, finance. Not only is there a flavor of a hackthon for each industry that requires a computer to work, other industries where computing is not so primary are also adapting the concept. Today, a typical hackathon is 24-48 hours long where participants usually use their skills around computing to create ingenuine products called "hacks". These could be a simple improvement to a website's front-end or replumbing of a more deeper sub-system. This could mean coming up with an new and disruptive outline for a math syllabus or a completely new instrument. this could means learning a new skill in a short time or coming up with a million dollar business idea. Hackathons have come to dominate and define the 2nd decade of this mellinium and it is only getting started. 

## Why attend a Hackathon?
Hackathons help you improve your skill set and have a strong impact on the overall life. 
They make way for you to get out of the normality of the day job (and hence your comfort zone) and get your hands dirty in a challenging environment. Most jobs tend to get tedious, boring or simply not challenging enough. Sometimes the job diverges from your original or current passion. This may be becasue of your own self or becasue of things not in your control. Hackathons reignite the passion. 

### Skills
While it may be obvious that a 24-48 hour sprint of code would certainly push the limits of a programmer and improving his skillset in a short period of time, other professionals can get a great skill set boost too. Skill set improvements come in two flavors: Technical and behavioral. Let's start with technical ones. 

#### Holistic experience
Hackathons provide a holistic experience of solving a problem or creating a product. While in the day job, you might be responsible for a small part of something big - at a hackathon there is usually a small team which owns big chunks  of solutions. From inception to delivery, you own the pipeline and whatever passes through it. It is incredibly empowering but also daunting.  

#### User experience
In most hackathons where you are creating a product prototype, the prime concern is the user experience. To the UX engineer, this may seem mundane - but it is incredibly important for other disciplines such as programmers, concept artists, engineers to put user experience first. You can get to learn UX tools, processes and common vocabulary. 

#### Cutting edge
Hackathons give you the leverage and freedom to be bold and risk taking. This means you can use whatever measures to complete your project including using the cutting edge technology. 

#### Existing tools
better understanding of working. novel usages. understanding of how tools work (or don't) with each other. 

#### 3rd Party tools
soon you will have a large repretoire of tools that other people make, and use them to create your solution. like uber was built using stripe and other tools. time to interact with those companies. time to understand the consideration that has gone into these tools. time to create your own such tools. Think about setting up a whole stack for a new application. Setup build with adruino and lego mindstom. A lot of hackers take pride, as badges, of which tools they used to create the solution. most time wheelinventors are a loss on hackathons.

### Behavioral
Hackathons are very commonly attributed for being behavior changing. Here are some of the things you can expect from attending hackathons:

#### code wins arguments
While some debate day in and out on the plausibility of a solution, a hacker goes out and codes it. Got an idea? Everyone does. Show us the code. Attending hackathons will instill in you a do vs talk habit. Most times, it does not take more than a focused weekend with a few talented people to really vhet out an idea. 

#### team work and interdependence
While the typical hollywood persona of a hacker is that of a lone hunter, hackathons are rarely considered individual battles. They are a team work. More often than not, the team consists of disparate individuals with different skill set. This creates an interesting setup for interdependence and team work. You will learn to ignore nuisances, weaknesses, personality lackings in others and you will start to see these in your own self if you have not seen already. Overcoming these will make you a stronger, resillient, more understanding person.

#### Pressure
The social pressure to win. the social pressure to live up to one's promise. add to that the 48 or 24 hour time constraint, team members you do not know about and other things. its a perfect setting for exercising the muscle of pressure. create endurance and sprint speed. increased focus. THe peer pressure to perform. 

#### Prioritization
While there may be room for losing time and redoing a particular piece of product at the cost of money, a hackathon does not have such a leverage. If you go down the wrong path, the price is paid, the time is lost and you must double up to cover up. It is then very important to prioritize the work and keep prioritizing based on the current situation. You will find yourself prioritizing and analyzing the cost/benefit of a particular task several times during the same hackathon. Sometimes, you will have to delay your meal because you prioritize the momentum of work - and sometimes you will have to prioritize sleep at the cost of current momentum because your prioritize the presentation over end product? 

#### rejection
Like code wins arguments, a hackathon is a commitment to accepting faliure or success. A hackathon is a win-win proposition. No one is a winner and everyone is a winner. everyone goes home proud. if your idea gets rejected or your team did not win anything or simply your idea was not liked at all, this is a place where this is rejoiced. a lot to unlearn from the societal norms. its okay to fail. its okay to crash. 

#### Completion 
initiation deficit
completion deficit
doing it over and over again, learning the feels of completing. 

#### Sportsmanship
Sportsmanship isn't about taking a losing in a good way but accepting success in a humbling way as well. Of about giving credit where its due. Of naming your team members in your success and highlight the giants upon whose shoulders you stand on. Hackathons will give you the oppertunity to improve upon your sportsmanship.

### Impact

#### Professional Impact
"Your network is your net worth". Hackathons are a great way to connect to the community of your discipline but also to expand into other disciplines. Its a great way for developers to connect with mentoring CEOs, designers, usability experts and even animal right activists. The data journalism hackathon called dhack brought together journalists, criminologists, public servants, developers and data scientists together. It would otherwise take a lot of hard work to get such a diverse group to sit together for even an hour, let alone a whole weekend. 

Hackathons also provide you an oppertunity to break into other fields of your occupation. A mobile developer experimenting with data science tools using crime data of his city not only expands his knowledge to data science but also to journalism. Learning by doing is a great way to expand the knowledge. 

We will see in later chapters that one of the major motivation for most organisations to throw a hackathon is so that they can find potential people to recruit. Hackathons are a great way to learn about other people you would want to work with. An interview only lasts an hour and is a very controlled environment. It also does not give oppertunity to see someone 'build' something, handle the pressure, prioritize, work with team members and handle rejection. More and more companies are investing heavily in throwing public hackathons that serve those who throw the hackathon and those who attend it. 

#### Personal Impact
Human fulfillment is a function that extends beyond job, salary and occassional fun. Humans want to connect with others. They need validation. Hackathons are a good place where you can lose yourself and connect to someone without the pressure of 'professionalism' and such. These interactions can someones lead to lasting friendships. 

Humans also seek to immortalize their existence in one way or the other. THey seek to leave behind a legacy, something that people may remember them with when they're gone. This drives the motivation to build things. Many people have an initiation deficit and hence cannot get their own selves to take the first steps towards building their dream product. Hackathon encourages and sometimes even tricks your brain into taking those first steps without you realising it. This brings immense personal satisfaction. More importantly, it brings encouragement and motivation to leverage the momentum. 

Soon the normalicy of the job kicks in. You have relationships, kids or other commitments and feel comfortable in them. To get thrown out of your comfort zone is the need of the hour for growth. Hackathons provide a controlled environment and platform to push yourself out of your comfortzone. Hackathons such as StartupWeekend force you to get out of your comfort zone as a developer and persue your product vision, get to the stage and pitch it and live up to the developer pristege you have gathered. Its a great place to challenge yourself into hustling to gain users, etc. 

#### Social Impact
Increasingly governments are realizing the potential of engaging the community in helping it solve problems thru technology. With help of volunteers or sometimes even private organisations, they throw a civic hackathon. CodeForAmerica and its spinoffs across the world are doing wonders in creating better communities and solving hard problems. Governments are also investing in collecting, cleaning and publicizing their data to rest of the world to hack on. Crime, Utility consumption and several other kinds of data are readily available now. This creates an unprecedented oppertunity for the people living in the mellenial era to solve problems are scale. Hackathons are the missing link between civics and capitalism. They connect the best minds busy to build the next great app or product to come and solve the next big problem, for a 100,000 people. 

Another social impact of hackathons is inspiring the upcoming gnerations to engage in meaningful, drug-free and fun events that not only streches their brain, it brings a sense of civics in them as well.

Major takeaways so far. 

# Do your homework 
Learn about who the judges are, who the investors are, what were previous projects at similar hackathon, who are the mentors, which teams have participated, etc. 

# Maintain an idea-list 
Capture everything all the time even if you are not participating actively in any hackathon. Ideas are really fragile so make sure to have an idea capture tool near you all the time. Simply capture and spend an hour a month going thru the ideas and triaging them. It will give a lot of confidence before entering or signing up a hackathon. Always explore ideas, tools, technologies and products. Be aware that an idea list is not a place to pass a judgement on how good or bad an idea is- just capture it.

# Maintain a hack-list
A hack list is a set of technologies you would like to hack on. Keep this list as your stumble across things that excite you. Hackathon is all about getting excited, gaining momentum and leveraging that momentum to build something new. The opposite of happiness is not sadness, its boredom. So what makes your excited makes you happy. To maximize your happiness, hack on something that excites you. How awful would it be to draw a blank when you ask yourself, what will excite me in this hackathon?

# Have a go-to language
Have a go-to language that you know really well. This is very true for competitive programming competitions but also in product building hackathons. Sticking to your favorite language such as python for web programming will greatly reduce the stress and you will be able to focus on more important things. Do not attempt an MVP hackathon if you don't know the technology very well. You will stumble across small issues that will destroy your hackathon if you don't know how to get around them. 

# Learn a stack
Learn a stack. Any stack. Stay within your stack. Web is a great platform to tease out ideas. Learning a web stack will give you immense power to articular your idea into an MVP. Do not learn just PHP or Python, learn the whole stack including Apache, MySQL, AngularJS, CSS, etc. Trust me, you don't want to waste the whole hackathon simply solving JS dependency issues. 

# Invest time on paper
If you cannot draw what you are going to build, you may not be able to build it good enough - especially if you are in a team. 

# Know your team
Really whet your team during socializing round for compatibility and technology. It will be a miserable hackathon if you have to ask for what you can work on or someone nagging you all the time about something or the other to teach them. 

Build team with compatible skills (iOS+Android does not work. Node+iOS works. Drupal+Design works. App designer + game designer may not work if your aim is to build a product). A new learner can slow down the whole team. A thing to ask is, "Is my skill set compatible with my team?". Its better to say no early than feel sorry for rest of 24 or 48 hours of hackathon. 

# Have a designer
Have a designer on call even if your ideas are not design heavy. A designer can mean the difference between a mediocre and killer MVP. A designer can even make your business plan more beautiful and give valuable advice. Mostly you don't need to code all the edge cases. A simply mockup and click dummy would do just as fine. 

# Fuck "Its been done"
Forget about "its been done". Life has been lived - but you don't stop living, right? Everyone's nature, nurture and experiences are different. Even Zuckerburg wouldn't invent Facebook if he had to today the same as he did so many years ago. Want to build a social network, go ahead! Make sure to elaborate on your value propositions though. Build that app you feel excited about even if everyone tells you it has already been done. 

# Version control extensively
Its easy to lose data so make sure you know your tools properly and all team members are using it. 

# Get organized
Use a PM tool early on. Simple as simple as Asana or Wunderlist is good. You simply need a way to capture ideas, triage them and categorize them. If you have access to a whiteboard, a Kanban board works too. 

# Brainstorm != Planning
Separate brainstorm from planning and time box both. There is so much energy and everyone has advices. But the truth is that you have limited time and you want to get out with a solid something to show. So brainstorm 20-30 minutes for idea generation and welcome all ideas. Then spend an hour or so planning from the brainstormed ideas and cut down as much as possible to make it a doable scope. Identify risks and make them visible to everyone.

# Identify goals and strech goals 
This is the holy grail of your hackathon. This will motivate to spent another hour, write 100 more lines of code. Be aggressive. Take risks. Pivot and restart if you have to.

# Sleep well
Get plenty of sleep before the hackathon. If you plan it well, you can get sleep during the hackathon too!

# Don't over caffinate
Don't over caffeinate if you don't have to. Do what makes you most productive - but red bull will not give you wings or magically make your AngularJS learning ability double for the day. 

# Don't over feed
Don't over feed yourself. It will make you sleepy. Try to eat a small meal every few hours. Know that it takes 20 minutes or your stomach to realize that it has had plenty. Some foods will make you sluggish. Sweets are good in small quantities.

# Isolate yourself
Get all your other affairs in order - turn off the phone or put it on "Do not disturb" mode. Make sure to inform friends and family ahead of time to not disturb you during these hours. Don't come to a hackathon unless you are fully committed to it. 

# Invest in 3rd Party code
Rely heavily on 3rd party components. Hacking is not only about taking things apart for the sake of putting them together or building from scratch, its about make a sum greater than the parts. Find parts which work in a more novel way together. 

Identify your goal for the hackathon from the following:

1. Learn a new technology (hack list, pet ideas)
2. Make an MVP. 
3. Tease a concept. 
4. Make a business plan. 

For 1, you need a list of technologies you want to learn and define what 'learn' means. Focus on the end result. Do homework. Build something similar to what you have already built. In words of marie monterssori, when learning a new concept - make some things constant. For example, when kids are taught colors and shapes, don't give them a blue circle and red square and expect them to not mix up what red and square means. Give her a red square and red circle and they will be able to learn what shapes are - and if you want them to learn colors, give them a yellow circle and blue circle. Similarly, if you have built a calculator in .NET for desktop but want to learn angular JS.. make the same calculator. Ideas are very effective at hiding the complexity under the wraps of simplicity. You don't have time to unravel this. 

For 2, you should really have a good command on the stack. You should know how each component in the stack works and what your limits are within it. If you are consuming APIs make sure you know, in your stack, how to efficiently parse and store JSON or XML. Learning it on the go is going to waste time. A hack around this is to use a third-party component. 

For 3, know a very good prototyping tool and have a good designer. As it eventually is all about presentation make sure you know your tools very well. Clarify early on what your prototype will be (a slideshow, click dummy, working prototype?). Unless you have design skills (visual and functional), do not attempt to tease this. It is not easy. Like I said earlier, complexity can be hidden under the layers of simple ideas. 


For 4, know your numbers. Know basic finances. Know your market and know your user base. have a designer and work on polishing the presentation. Poke holes in your business plan. 

"Having fun" is not a goal. The fact that you showed up at the hackathon means that the fun has started. Now is the time to go through the pain. 


You will need experience in any of these categories to gain reasonable results at the end of the hackathon. Experience hackers can aim for multiple or even all of the above goals but it is going to be incredible hard. I do not recommend for beginners as even I don't consider myself to be at that level yet. (does it even exist?)



Balance pain and pleasure. 

Work backwards if there is a presentation involved. Think about how your demo would be like. Think of the mimic possible demo wit hate maximum possible effect.
