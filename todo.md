# personal hackathon exeperience
- LeWeb (Remote - Paris) - 2010, Retilo News, Alcatel-Lucent, Titanium Appcelerator, time spent in learning appcelerator - but was a strategic decision to include other team members but also to do rapid development. Alcatel-Lucent realtime API parsing was also more efficient done in JS. We had a designer, a middle-tier JS engineer and two mobile engineers. We had a fairly solidly designed application that performed fast too. It was a news app that took advantage of the real time APIs provided by alcatel lucent. The learning curve for JS is refreshingly easy - but since it does add a layer on top of iOS, you lose a lot of control. Depending on what kind of hack you are working on, this can be a blessing or curse. 
 
# AngelHack (Remote - SF) - 2012, HOBZ, iOS Native, Basecamp (lot of time waste in oAuth).
## Who was on the team?
We were 3 hackers. 2 iOS and one general. He is a product guy.  
## How did you hear about the hackathon? 
We happened to be in SanFrancisco around the time and had an entry pass (for another reason).
## what was the big idea?
We created an iOS Application that authenticates thru company's basecamp account and lets you push messages to your colleagues in 140 or less characters. You can use hashtags and people tags (like twitter) and you also attach an emoticon. The idea was to track the emotions over time and aggregate the data in the long run.  
## How did you come up with the idea?
We had an ideas brainstorm the night before. The three of us put on table our ideabooks. This particular idea originally called "Clienty" to keep track of my client's ever changing moods so that I can ensure equilibrium across my clientele. We changed it slightly to an internal tool to pass short messages with emotion. This required hooking up with a system that companies already use for quicker adaption (shoulnt have care about it at that point and should have just worked on the product design itself - in retrospect). The reason we chose this idea over the other was its 'doability' and our general excitement about the idea. Its important that everyone in the team feels pasionate about the idea itself. While there were other projects on the ideaboook which were interesting, they were either too dreamy or too big to execute rapidly (or atleast we didn't know how to). 
## What were the major achievements from the hackathon?
We came up with a pretty solid useable application and it was fun. We learned the ins and outs of Basecamp API and ways to manage data internally. My group mate and I were very keen on keeping the code clean at that point. We increased our stamina to pull off an all nighter. 
## How did you make the technology choice?
Though this app could have lent it self much better to Appcelerators rapid development cycle, we chose native. We use the basecamp classic API to create a login. 
## What challenges did you face?
Two experienced developers but one got tired early. we chose to work in the office and had power breakdowns. [It pays off to prepare mentally ahead of time. most hackathons will land on weekends and if you are not mentally prepared in the week before, you may be overworked with no energy left for the weekend]. Also, the more hackathons you attend, the better you will understand your own physiology and psychology. Everyone has different productive zones. On a technical note, we wasted a lot of time with oAuth and parsing various variations of the same API. 

# ISB Civic hackathon - CodeForPakistan (ISB) - 2015, 
## Who was on the team
We were three people. 1 iOS engineer, 1 Android engineer-cum-designer and 1 product guy. 
## HOw did you hear about the hackathon?
Thru social media. It was organized by CodeForpakistan and had some covereage on the social media. Its one of the first major civic hackathons and was well recieved in the technology and public service community. We quickly jumped on the oppertunity (even though it was 5 hours drive away from my city).
## what was the big idea?
We created two applications. one for what we call "scouts" who find and post civic projects at a central location. These could be broken road or any other problem of a civic nature. The second app was for volunteers who can browse thru all projects in their vicinity, join them, share it with people and fix them. 
## HOw did you come up with the idea?
The night before we had a small brainstoming session where we put our ideabooks on the table. There was some on the go brainstorming as well. We looked at previous civic projects and what the hackathon organizer offered as advice. We picked "hull" because of its simplicity and how we could relate to it - all three of us. 
## What were the major achievements from the hackathon?
We were able to hustle and get savaree's founder/designer to critque and help on our app. (I doubt she even remembers anymore). The key insight: don't code! This was not a "code night". This was about coming up and prototyping rapidly ideas to engage people in a civic nature and solve civic hackathons (in case you are building a product). 
## How did you make the technology choice?
This was an odd team with an iOS and an Android engineer together. Luckily, we had two different mutually exclusive parts of the application so we decided to create both in different platforms for the demo purposes. To unify the two systems, we use Parse at the backend to store all our data. It was so easy to integrate parse across the platforms that way. We got cross paltform push notifications for free. 
## What challenges did you face?
We had to think really hard on how the product will eventually work. We worked hard on defining our personas and what they wanted from the application - what are the long term goals of a users. We iterated using paper mockups. We were very focused on clarifying user's intention. I think the lack of a designer/UX person (who knew thee tools really well and could mockup really quickly) was our major challenge. 
## Any other takeaways?
Always know the format of the hackathon. If you are given 3 minutes to pitch your idea in the end, don't worry too much about the implementation or the demo. Make sure to have a designer on speed dial or learn the design skills. 



- NASA SpaceApps Challenge (ISB) - 2015, predefined topics, iOS Native, Multi-peer connectivity and Motion Kit. Avoided data driven. Worked backwards of what we wanted to demo. Team of experienced iOS engineers. Our group of 7 split into 3 teams. Naveed and myself from AngelHack experience decided to work on the space glove problem. Team A worked on crop data and team B worked on ... [??] - there were 5 minute demo/presentations. Another team brought a robot they made in another project earlier that year and demo'd it. It was a team of about 15 people of very talented engineers but their idea and work was shot down. [It pays to stay geniune and not trying to game the system]. We ended up winning the second prize locally but were selected to represent Pakistan in the international SpaceApps competition. We were picked for people's choice awards, were in top 10 but lost in the end to voting. We had alot of press. 

- Lahore StartupWeekend (LHE) - 2015, prepared idea, time waste in learning to prototype the application (we wanted to use the Google material design with angular). Divided between presentation and code. Should have worked more on UI and presentation - the idea was not totally understandable by everyone. The atmostphere was most energetic. [Expect some issues when some or most of your team members, or yourself even, are not familiar and experienced with the hackathons]. 20 minute brainstorm, 20 minute vote/discussion. 

- HackerRank CodeSprints (Online) - 2015 - Individual Competitive programming hackathon. 5 problems ranging in difficulty. Favorite kind of hackathons - very heady and intense. we had a few redbulls so that did slightly make me jittery. It was on a weekend and we had had a tough week. Thrilling as it may sound or feel, it is almost never a good idea to burn out. 

- TopCoder SRMs (Online) - 2008-2015 - 75 minute individual matches with challenge round, system tests.. very doable if your time matches. 

- Yelp Hackathon 18 (SF) - 2015, 

- Internal hackathons at Coeus (Python, NodeJS, SimpleDiary) - 2010-2015
