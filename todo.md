# personal hackathon exeperience
- LeWeb (Remote - Paris) - 2010, Retilo News, Alcatel-Lucent, Titanium Appcelerator, time wasted in learning appcelerator - but was a strategic decision to include other team members but also to do rapid development. We had a designer, a backend JS engineer and two mobile engineers. We had a fairly solidly designed application that performed fast too. It was a news app that took advantage of the real time APIs provided by alcatel lucent. 
 
- AngelHack (Remote - SF) - 2012, HOBZ, iOS Native, Basecamp (lot of time waste in oAuth). Two experienced developers but one got tired early. we chose to work in the office and had power breakdowns. [It pays off to prepare mentally ahead of time. most hackathons will land on weekends and if you are not mentally prepared in the week before, you may be overworked with no energy left for the weekend]. 

- ISB Civic hackathon - CodeForPakistan (ISB) - 2015, idea selection brainstorm, technology selection, PARSE, iOS+Android, good paper design work. Presentation brainstorm. 1 iOS developer and 1 iOS developer. One all rounder product manager. Since the application depended on different kinds of users, we made one flow (the scouts) in iOS and the volunteers can use the Android app. Using Parse gave us the flexibility to update the schemas as we go without writing any backend code.  We were given 3 minutes to pitch the idea and won the people's choice award. [Invest more time in polishing the product than pulling hair in coding]. 

- NASA SpaceApps Challenge (ISB) - 2015, predefined topics, iOS Native, Multi-peer connectivity and Motion Kit. Avoided data driven. Worked backwards of what we wanted to demo. Team of experienced iOS engineers. Our group of 7 split into 3 teams. Naveed and myself from AngelHack experience decided to work on the space glove problem. Team A worked on crop data and team B worked on ... [??] - there were 5 minute demo/presentations. Another team brought a robot they made in another project earlier that year and demo'd it. It was a team of about 15 people of very talented engineers but their idea and work was shot down. [It pays to stay geniune and not trying to game the system]. We ended up winning the second prize locally but were selected to represent Pakistan in the international SpaceApps competition. We were picked for people's choice awards, were in top 10 but lost in the end to voting. We had alot of press. 

- Lahore StartupWeekend (LHE) - 2015, prepared idea, time waste in learning to prototype the application (we wanted to use the Google material design with angular). Divided between presentation and code. Should have worked more on UI and presentation - the idea was not totally understandable by everyone. The atmostphere was most energetic. [Expect some issues when some or most of your team members, or yourself even, are not familiar and experienced with the hackathons]. 20 minute brainstorm, 20 minute vote/discussion. 

- HackerRank CodeSprints (Online) - 2015 - Individual Competitive programming hackathon. 5 problems ranging in difficulty. Favorite kind of hackathons - very heady and intense. we had a few redbulls so that did slightly make me jittery. It was on a weekend and we had had a tough week. Thrilling as it may sound or feel, it is almost never a good idea to burn out. 

- TopCoder SRMs (Online) - 2008-2015 - 75 minute individual matches with challenge round, system tests.. very doable if your time matches. 

- Yelp Hackathon 18 (SF) - 2015, 

- Internal hackathons at Coeus (Python, NodeJS, SimpleDiary) - 2010-2015
